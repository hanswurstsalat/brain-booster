## My first little react-game
I've just started to learn react. This is my first little game. Based on an electronic game created in 1978, called "Simon" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)). In Germany it was called "Senso".

Built with parcel. Sounds realized with useSound-hook form Josh Comeau (https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound).
